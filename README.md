# Prodigy_DS_03

as a data sciense intern at Prodigy_infotech i have completed my second task, Task03: Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
